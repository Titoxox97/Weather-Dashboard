# Weather-Dashboard

<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>Creat an application that will allow users to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, so they can plan trips accordingly.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>With the use of API's and third party libraries, I was able to make it so when one refreshed the browser their previous search history would load from the local storage</p>

<p>I created a function that owould load data from the local storage</p>

<p>Implemented an api into the js file to load the weather data of the city typed into the search bar for a five day period</p>

<p>Another api was implemented in order to load data from the UV index</p>

<p>I then used design functions to color code the UV ratings to determine how cautious one should be highlighted green if the rating is favorable, moderate, extreme, or unknown</p>
